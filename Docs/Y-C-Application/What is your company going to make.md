WhoWhe2Wha is a “living timeline” that unifies projects, prep work, and social logistics in one context-aware view. Instead of juggling calendars, kanban boards, and email threads, users drag templates (travel, exams, launches) onto an infinite zoomable timeline that shows workload density, prep windows, and constraints in a single glance. Events are richer than calendar appointments—they carry impact/risk tags, embedded notes/pitches, and optionally sync through the user’s own storage (Drive/iCloud) or our managed service. Collaboration happens inside each event via comments, voting, and shareable proposal pages, so planning a Hartford reunion or coordinating an actuarial exam prep block feels more like manipulating a visual operating system than emailing spreadsheets.
