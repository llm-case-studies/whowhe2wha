Clickable prototype (public GitHub Pages build) with the core experience working: zoomable timeline, tiered project lanes, history sidebar, CSV/mock data import, AI-assisted search via Gemini, Google Places-powered location finder, and smooth Maps integration for travel. No external users yet beyond myself and my wife, but the daily driver I use for my own work/personal planning is the same code we just deployed.
