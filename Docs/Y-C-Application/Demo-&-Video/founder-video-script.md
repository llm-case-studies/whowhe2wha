Founder Video Script (60 seconds)
---------------------------------

Hi, I’m Alex Sudakov, founder of WhoWhe2Wha.
I’ve spent 20+ years building workflow software inside reinsurance companies while juggling family logistics, tennis leagues, and actuarial exams.
Traditional tools silo everything—calendars, kanban boards, spreadsheets—so one life event like a Hartford reunion means juggling travel, prep, and social threads across five apps.
WhoWhe2Wha is a living timeline that unifies projects, prep work, travel, and collaboration. You drag templates—travel, exam prep, product launches—onto a zoomable rail and instantly see workload density, prep windows, conversations, even location suggestions in one place.
I started this build on November 3rd. AI collaborators like Grok, Gemini, Codex CLI, and Claude let me ship a polished timeline, templates, and Google Places integration in a week. YC is where I want to pressure-test distribution and build the managed sync layer beyond the current GitHub Pages demo.
Thanks for your time—I’d love to show you WhoWhe2Wha live.
