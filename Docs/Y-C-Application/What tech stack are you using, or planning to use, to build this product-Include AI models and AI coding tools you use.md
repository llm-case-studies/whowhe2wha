Current stack: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite on the frontend, Tailwind-esque utility classes, and a local-first data layer (IndexedDB for now). We integrate Google Maps/Places APIs for deterministic location search, and Gemini 1.5 via the `@google/genai` SDK for context-aware timeline queries. Source control is GitHub; deployments run through Vite→GitHub Pages today, moving to Vercel once auth/sync land. For AI-assisted coding I occasionally use GitHub Copilot and Cursor to stub UI pieces. Roadmap includes adding Replicache/ElectricSQL for sync, a Supabase (Postgres) backend for managed storage, and eventually CRDT replication so families can host their data in Google Drive/iCloud if they prefer. The UI already ships through an i18n scaffold (English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese) so we can localize into additional markets by dropping new translation bundles.
