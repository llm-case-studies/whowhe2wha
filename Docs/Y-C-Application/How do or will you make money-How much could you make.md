Freemium: the free tier lets individuals host data in their own Google Drive/iCloud/Dropbox. The paid tier ($12–$18/user/month) provides our managed sync, real-time collab, AI prep suggestions, and premium templates (travel, exam, fundraising). Long term we can layer in enterprise licensing for teams that need compliance exports or custom templates (insurers, consulting shops). If we capture even 0.1% of the ~50M U.S. knowledge workers who juggle structured projects + personal logistics, that’s a $72M ARR business; the broader TAM (global professional/household planners) pushes it into hundreds of millions.
