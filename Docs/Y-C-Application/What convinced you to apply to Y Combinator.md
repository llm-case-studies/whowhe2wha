I’ve followed YC since the early calendaring/knowledge tools (Sunrise, Cron, Reclaim). YC consistently backs founders who reimagine workflows, and I want that peer group + push while turning WhoWhe2Wha from a polished prototype into a company. Hearing alumni talk about the speed/reset they got (most recently at YC Build) convinced me this is the fastest path to pressure-test distribution, pricing, and collaboration features.
