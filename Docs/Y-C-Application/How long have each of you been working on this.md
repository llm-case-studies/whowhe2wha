I started this specific incarnation of WhoWhe2Wha on Nov 3, 2025, after my wife suggested turning an actuary exam-planning tool from my ActCLI suite into a general-purpose context engine. Grok helped brainstorm the name/concept that day, and within 72 hours Gemini in Google AI Studio helped spike the initial UI. Once the codebase outgrew AI Studio I moved the repo local and continued full-time in VS Code with Codex CLI and Claude. So it’s been one very intense week so far, 100% of it full-time.
