Closest comparisons are Notion (databases + templates), Motion/Sunsama (calendar+task blends), ClickUp/Asana (project management), and horizontal calendars like Cron or Apple/Google Calendar. None treat the timeline as a first-class operating system: they either silo projects from calendars or force users into kanban/list paradigms. WhoWhe2Wha’s differentiator is the living timeline with zoomable context, rich event semantics (prep windows, proposals, travel), and the ability to self-host data (Drive/iCloud) or use our managed sync. It feels more like Lightroom for your life/work plan than another calendar.
