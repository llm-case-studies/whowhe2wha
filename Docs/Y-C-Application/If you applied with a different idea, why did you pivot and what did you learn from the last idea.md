I previously applied with other experiments—StockPolls (community investing), iHomeNerd/iOfficeNerd (IoT concierge), and PronunCo (multilingual pronunciation tutor). Each taught me something: how to run remote beta programs, how hard hardware loops are, and how to ship compact language features. Since Fall 2024 two things changed: (1) the AI toolchain (Codex CLI, Claude CLI, Gemini 2.5 Pro) became strong enough that a solo founder can build a polished planner quickly, and (2) I’ve learned how to collaborate with those models effectively. WhoWhe2Wha also fits that tooling perfectly: React/Vite + AI pair programming lets me ship timeline breakthroughs in days instead of months, so this idea is already far further along than the previous submissions.
