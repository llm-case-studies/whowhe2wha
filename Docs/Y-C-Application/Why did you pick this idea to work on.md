For 20+ years I’ve built actuarial workflow software inside reinsurance companies while juggling family life, tennis leagues, and professional exams. Enterprise tools handle one layer at a time (project plans, calendars, CRMs), but they never reconcile prep work, travel, and social commitments into a single picture. I’ve watched underwriters, actuaries, and even tennis captains drown in spreadsheets trying to coordinate “who/where/when,” so I built the tool I’ve wanted for years: a living timeline that fuses structured data with templates and collaboration. Early conversations with coworkers and community organizers surfaced the same pain—people spend more time reconciling tools than moving work forward.
